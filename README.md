# Gregorian dates to stardates converter

## What!?

`stardate.py` is a less-than-100 lines Python program that converts a date in the stardates from the _Star Trek_ franchise.

## Why!?

Because I was bored.

Still, it can be useful in some situations:

- in role-play games, for the game master to keep consistent stardates;
- to impress people in society (but you're more likely to look like an illogical alien);
- to help scriptwriters to keep consistent stardates in their scripts, assuming it matters to them.

## How!?

This program was in large part inspired from [this work](http://uss-france.strangewc.com/convers.htm).

Below is an explanation of the method from the website, translated with DeepL:

> Before the Federation was created, the Earthlings used the Gregorian calendar. However, the meeting with the Vulcans brought this calendar into question: the Vulcan year did not last 365 days and the Vulcans found the succession of months of 28, 29, 30 or 31 days particularly illogical!
> 
> The administration of the Federation therefore decided to implement a new calendar that would not correspond to any existing system. The new system was implemented on January 4, 2162 at midnight. This date was declared "stardate 0" and each Earth day is worth 5 units. After about five years, the stardate should have changed to 10000 but was reset to zero, becoming stardate [1]0000. This reset occurred every five and a half years.
> 
> In 2266, a Federation commission met to find a new and more appropriate rating system. It submitted its report in 2267, stating that the new system should be 0.1 units per earth day. This new calculation method was instituted on January 26, 2270 (stardate [19]7340) and was tested for a duration of 500 units (5000 earth days).
> 
> In 2280, the commission listed the criticisms about the new stardate and concluded that the new calculation method lacked precision, since the minimum precision (1 day) required one decimal place. A new system was created and implemented from 5 October 2283. In this new system, each Earth day was worth 0.5 units. Thus, each day could be divided into periods of 0.1 units.
> 
> As time passed, Federation ships flew missions further and further away from Earth to planets whose cycles were entirely different from those of Earth. The Federation decided to introduce a new date format, completely free of the Earth's cycles. It was decided that this new system would reuse the two previous principles. Thus, each year was arbitrarily divided into 1000 units and a decimal point was used to specify the periods of the day. This system was introduced on January 1, 2323 and has been in effect ever since.
